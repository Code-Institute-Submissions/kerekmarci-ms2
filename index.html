        <p>
            The object of the game is to find all pairs of matching cards as quickly as possible.
            Two cards can be turned up at the same time, and if the face of the cards is identical, it's a match.

            There are 3 levels available:
            <ul>
                <li>Easy: 12 cards</li>
                <li>Medium: 20 cards</li>
                <li>Hard: 30 cards</li>
            </ul>          

            Enjoy!
        </p>
