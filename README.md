## Description

The website presents a pattern-matching memory game, fun way of using our memory to find matching pairs of cards, written in JavaScript.

---

## User Experience

The website uses straightforward and intuitive navigation. After the introduction of the rules, the user can proceed to the game area by pressing the ‘Go to game’ button. 
At the game area the user can select among easy, medium and hard levels (by pressing the respective buttons). During the game, the time and number of steps are measured. 
At the end of the game, the user can add him/herself onto the leader board, and also able to leave a feedback if wishes.

### Strategy

The main goal of this 2nd Milestone project was to build an interactive website using JavaScript. Therefore, the strategy was to develop a game suitable for both children and adults:
 for children, this intuitive game is both a challenge and fun to find matching cars, for adults, this can be used as a brain-sharpener, but for many of us, 
 this type of game brings back childhood memories.
